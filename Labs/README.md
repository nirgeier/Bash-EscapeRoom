## Intro

- **The inspiration comes from [github.com/andrey-zap/escapeRoomLinux](https://github.com/andrey-zap/escapeRoomLinux)**
- This tutorial is for teaching bash scripting through puzzles designed as escape rooms.
- Each room is packaged in its own folder and includes the files, scripts, and assets required to play.
- Every room folder includes a `README` that describes the room's objectives, hints, rules, and how to verify the solution.
- The Bash Escape Room is a series of bash puzzles (Escape-rooms, rooms similar to the real-life attractions of Escape rooms).
- The Bash Escape Room puzzles are designed to teach the players Bash and Linux skills & features.
- The inspiration for this project is the real-life Escape rooms.
