## Objective: Get past the locked door by extracting the key from the JavaScript script

```markdown
To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- To proceed you need to figure out a way to get past the locked door. 
- In order to open the door you will need to do the following:
  1. Extract the key that is hidden inside the script in this folder.

Hints:
  * Find out the type of the script - in which language the script is written?
  * The information on how to lock the door is hidden as `Extended Attribute`
  * Once you figure out what need to be done - just execute the `lockedDoor` script 

In case you are really lost - unlock the hint script in this folder (key=hints)
```

  1. Determine the programming language of the script.
   
    !!! tip "Identify File Type"
    
        - Use the `file` command to identify the file type.
        - You will need to install `file` it if not already available.
    
  2. Check for extended attributes on the script file.
    
    !!! tip "Extended Attributes"
    
        - Extended attributes store additional metadata.
        - The attribute should provide clues on how to run the script.
        - Find out the required flags for the `getfattr` command.
        - If `getfattr` is not available, you may need to install it.
        
  3. Install the required tool you found in the previous step.
               
  4. Execute the script with the correct parameter.
     
    !!! warning ""

        - Based on the extended attribute, run the script with the specified argument.
        - This should reveal the key for the next room.

  5. Use the key to proceed to the next room.
     
    !!! warning ""

        The password for the next room is `********` ðŸ˜Š.
