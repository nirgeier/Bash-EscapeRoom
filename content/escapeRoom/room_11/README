- Congratulations! You have reached room 11!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this room, we dive into bash conditionals and decision-making.
- You need to write a bash script that processes user data and filters based on conditions.
- In this room we wish to learn and use `awk` and learn some of its capabilities. 
- awk is most commonly used for `pattern matching` or `text processing`
  
Tasks
------

1. Examine the 'user_data.txt' file in this folder.
2. Write a bash script named 'filter_users.sh' that:
   - The file contains a header and each line contains user information in the format: name,age,subscription
   - Reads each line from 'user_data.txt' 
   - Using `bash` and `awk`, filter users based on the following criteria:
     - Skip the header line (First line - Find out how to do this using `awk`)
     - Age greater than 25  (Hint: This is the second field in each line)
     - Subscription type is 'premium' (Hint: This is the third field in each line)
   - Sums the ages of the matching users, and this sum will be the password for the next room.

3. Run your script to get the password for the next room.

Good Luck!!!
