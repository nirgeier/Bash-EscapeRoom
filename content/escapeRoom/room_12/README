- Congratulations! You have reached room 12!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this room, we focus on xargs.
- You have a file named addresses.txt which contains 1000 lines of addresses in the following format:
  "Name,Street,City,State,ZipCode"
- Your task is to calculate the sum of all the ZipCodes in the file using xargs.
- You can use any other command you need, but the main focus should be on using xargs effectively.
  
Tasks:
------

1. Examine the 'addresses.txt' file in this folder.
2. Extract the ZipCode from each line. (Hint: ZipCode is the 5th field in each line, you can use `cut` command)
3. Use `xargs` to format the output into 5 columns (You will need to find out the xargs flag).
   - Command: `cut -d, -f5 addresses.txt | xargs -n5`
<!-- 4. 
5. Calculate the sum of all ZipCodes in the file using xargs.
   - Command: `echo addresses.txt | xargs head -n 1000 | cut -d, -f5 | xargs -n5 | xargs printf "%s+" | sed 's/.$//' | xargs -I {} echo {} | bc`
   - To sum only the 5th line in the output: `echo addresses.txt | xargs head -n 1000 | cut -d, -f5 | xargs -n5 | sed -n '5p' | xargs printf "%s+" | sed 's/+$//' | bc`
6. The sum will be the password for the next room. -->


echo addresses.txt   | \
  xargs head -n 1000  | \
  cut -d, -f5 | \
  xargs -n5 | \
  xargs printf "%s+" | \
  sed 's/.$//' | \
  xargs -I {}  | \
  bc


Good Luck!!!
