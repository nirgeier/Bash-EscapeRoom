- Congratulations! You have reached room 10!!

To pass this room:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- In this room, we focus on bash loops and arrays.
- You need to write a bash script that processes a list of palindrome items.

Palindrome: 
      a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward   
      (e.g., mom, madam, racecar, level).

Tasks:
------

1. Examine the 'treasure_list.txt' file in this folder.
2. Write a bash script named 'find_treasure.sh' that:
   - Reads all the lines (items) into an array.
   - Filters out (remove) items that are not palindromes.
   - Takes the first letter of each item in the **exact order** its in the array.
   - Outputs the concatenated letters as the password (lowercase).

3. Recommended steps to complete the task:
   - Use a loop to read lines from 'treasure_list.txt' into an array.
     - Hint: You can read a file line by line using (IFS= read -r line)
   - Use a function to check if a word is a palindrome.
     - Hint: You can reverse a string using 'rev' command.
   - Filter the array and build the password.
   - Print the final password.
4. Run your script to get the password for the next room.

Good Luck!!!
