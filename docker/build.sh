build.sh
---------
Small helper for building and pushing a multi-architecture Docker image
for the Bash Escape Room project using Docker Buildx and a docker-compose
build definition.

What this script does (high level):
	1. Locates the git repository root and cd's there so paths are predictable.
	2. Ensures the host supports emulating other CPU architectures by
		 registering binfmt handlers (via tonistiigi/binfmt).
	3. Creates and switches to a docker buildx builder instance named
		 `multiarch-builder` and bootstraps it.
	4. Runs `docker buildx bake` with the project's docker-compose.yml to
		 build and push the image(s) defined in that file.

Usage:
	./build.sh

Requirements / Preconditions:
	- Docker (Engine) installed and running on the host
	- docker buildx available (Docker >= 19.03 with buildx plugin or
		Docker Desktop which bundles it)
	- You must be logged in to the GitHub Container Registry:
		echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
	- You must be logged in to Docker Hub:
		docker login -u USERNAME
	- This script must be executed from a git working tree (it uses
		`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to find the project root).

Notes / Behavior details:
	- The script uses the container image `tonistiigi/binfmt` to register
		qemu/binfmt handlers for cross-architecture emulation. That requires
		`--privileged` to the runner container (the temporary container).
	- This script creates a buildx builder named `multiarch-builder` and
		switches the current Docker context to use it. If you run this script
		multiple times, buildx will silently re-use an existing builder
		with the same name, or fail if it exists in a conflicting state.
	- The final build step uses `docker buildx bake` with the
		`docker/docker-compose.yml` file and targets the service
		named `escape-room-bash` (this is defined in the repo's compose file).

Customization:
	- You can change the image name and tag by exporting IMAGE and IMAGE_TAG
		before running the script, e.g.:
			IMAGE=ghcr.io/nirgeier/bash-escaperoom IMAGE_TAG=v1.2.3 ./build.sh

Failure modes:
	- If Docker is not running, commands will fail.
	- If `git rev-parse` fails (not a git repo), the script will abort.
	- If you are not logged into ghcr.io, the push step will fail.

# docker-compose bake file consistent regardless of where the script is
# invoked from.

# Step 2: Register binfmt handlers for multi-architecture emulation.

# `--use` makes the new builder the current default for buildx operations.
# If the builder already exists, just switch to it.

# Step 3: Bootstrap the builder. This starts the builder container
# and registers its capabilities (including the registered binfmt
# handlers) so the builder is ready to run multi-platform builds.
echo "Bootstrapping buildx builder..."

# Step 4: Build and push using `docker buildx bake`.
# Run from docker/ so that context: .. in the compose file resolves to the repo root.
